    "### SpikeTrain visualization\n",
    "1. Load the data `i140703-001.nix` file using the `neo.io.NixIO` into a neo Block.\n",
    "2. Here we will only investigate data measured between 2 seconds - 12 seconds of the datasets. Create a new neo Segment that only contains data of that time range.\n",
    "3. Select all SpikeTrains that are marked as single unit activity and are annotated with `unit_id` 1. How many of those SpikeTrains exist in the dataset?\n",
    "4. Plot the spike times of these spike trains in a raster plot (plot of spike times as dots or ticks over time). Use the `connector_aligned_id` as vertical offset for each Spiketrain avoid overlapping spike markers.\n",
    "5. Add vertical lines to indicate event times labeled as `TS-ON`, `SR`, `OT` and `RW-ON`.\n",
